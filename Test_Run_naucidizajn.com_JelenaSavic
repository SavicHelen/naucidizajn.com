**Improvements:**

| **Homepage improvements:** |
 |
 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ID:** | **Current:** | **Requested:** | **Reason:** |
| Impr H01 | Button Kursevi is not clickable but shows a dropdown menu with multiple clickable features.
 Button Vidi Kurseve is clickable and leads to the courses section on the homepage, it has no dropdown feature. | The button Kursevi is redundant and it should be removed.
 Its dropdown feature should be given to the Vidi kurseve button.
 Vidi kurseve button to be displayed instead of Kursevi button, next to Mentorstvo button. | The user will be able to find the right information on the right button.
 That way, the user will be able to see the dropdown menu when hovering
 and will be able to see the courses section on the homepage when clicking the Vidi kurseve button. |
| Impr H02 | Button Kursevi is not clickable but shows a dropdown menu with multiple clickable features sectioned in two columns Kursevi and Paketi.
 So the information about packages is not easily accessible nor in the place it is expected to be. | The dropdown menu below the Vidi kurseve button should be showing only courses.
 Add the Paketi button in the headline. Paketi button to be clickable and lead to packages section on the homepage when clicked.
 Also, Paketi button to show dropdown feature with packages menu when hovered. | This way the name of the button will justify the information shown when hovered.
 The user will be clear with what courses he can buy on the page.
 The information about packages will be given in a clear and concise way, in the place the user expects it to be displayed. |
| Impr H03 | The user can find the Blog section lower on the page and the same section is linked in the footer of the homepage. | Blog section should be added in the headline as a clickable button. After clicking it should redirect to the Blog section. | This way the Blog section will be more visible and the content on the page will seem to be well structured and organized. |
| Impr H04 | In the Homepage, in the section Program mentorstva, after the title there's a text:
 "Tu sam da ti prenesem svo svoje znanje i iskustvo, i da te ispratim na putu do posla u firmi ili prvog freelance klijenta."
 The same text is in the section Slack grupa in the same page. | Change the text in the section Slack grupa. | The displayed text doesn't show the real purpose of the slack group and is more appropriate for the Mentorstvo section. |
| **Blog section improvement:** |
 |
 |
| **ID:** | **Current:** | **Requested:** | **Reason:** |
| Impr B01 | If the user is about to see the green arrows in the Blog section, he is not able to see the full titles of the blog posts he's browsing through.
 The user needs to scroll down to see the title of the post, and scroll back to see the arrow to move to the next text. | Remove the arrows left/right in the section title.
 Add left and right arrows on the blog pictures line. (carrousel field)
 Remove drag/drop tool. | The arrows are not easy to use because the user needs to scroll up and down to see the arrows and the titles of the posts.
 Arrows in the carousel field is a user-friendly way of going through the blog post titles. |
| Impr B02 | Below the title of the blog post there is the Pročitaj button.
 The Pročitaj button is clickable as well as the title of the post, as well as the picture of the post. | Remove Pročitaj button. | Pročitaj button is not necessary given the fact that clicking on the title and clicking on the picture of the post are leading to the wanted text.
 Also, the Pročitaj button makes the whole carousel look more robust and the buttons aren't visible if not scrolled down enough. |
| **Web Dizajn Page improvements:** |
| **ID:** | **Current:** | **Requested:** | **Reason:** |
| Impr WD01 | In the section O predavaču in the page Web Dizajn kurs,
 the follow-up text for predavač Voja is the same as for the predavač Nikola. | Adjust the text to the lecturer's personality and features. | Two mentors should be described in different words, it gives them more credibility in the eyes of the customer. |
