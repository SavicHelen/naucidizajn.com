|Blog section improvement:| | | |
|Improvement ID:|Current:|Requested:|Reason:|
|Impr B01|If the user is about to see the green arrows in the Blog section, he is not able to see the full titles of the blog posts he's browsing through.  The user needs to scroll down to see the title of the post, and scroll back to see the arrow to move to the next text. |Remove the arrows left/right in the section title. Add left and right arrows on the blog pictures line. (carrousel field) Remove drag/drop tool.  |The arrows are not easy to use because the user needs to scroll up and down to see the arrows and the titles of the posts.  Arrows in carrousel field is user friendly way of going through the blog post titles.|
|Impr B02|Below the title of the blog post there is the Pročitaj button.  The Pročitaj button is clickable as well as title of the post, as well as the picture of the post. |Remove Pročitaj button.|Pročitaj button is not necessary given the fact that clicking on the title and clicking on the picture of the post are leading to the wanted text.  Also, Pročitaj button makes the whole carrousel look more robust and the buttons aren't visible if not scrolled down enough. |
